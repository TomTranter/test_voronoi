Desc: This script will generate a vornoi diagram around a set of points and also offset the vertices of 
the voronoi regions to represent fibres of radius r. Statistics about the pores and throats are generated and
the total porosity is also calculated. A probablity function is used to seed points with a slightly higher density
at the boundaries. This replicates the work described in "Random Pore Network Modeling of Fibrous PEMFC Gas Diffusion Media Using Voronoi and Delaunay Tessellations",
